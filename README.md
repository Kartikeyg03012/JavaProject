4. Methodology 
•	The approach employed in designing the proposed system is the Rational Unified Process (RUP). The RUP 
•	methodology is based on the fact that the system represents an organized way of gathering business 
•	Requirements and building the goal of the project. This was employed, because it is an object-oriented and web-enabled program development methodology and also a framework for developing software systems. It also clearly outlines the different roles of the individuals involved in the project, such as the project manager, 

5. System Testing and Component Testing 
System testing is the integration of two or more components of a system as it relates to the functionality of the 
system and running an integrated test on the entire system. The software was tested with Web browsers namely 
Internet Explorer 8, Google Chrome version 47.6 and Opera 35.0. Windows OS and Mac OS and WAMP server 
version 2.5 was also used to test the software. 
Component testing also known as module testing is the process of testing the individual components of the 
system to determine if its desired functionality is met. It helps to find defect in components or modules of a 
system; making sure all faults in the components are exposed for correction. Component testing is essential 
because it helps to find bugs before integration testing is carried out. 







6.User Validation 
Login page
 
shows the user validation page. In the event that a user who intends to have access to the system but 
ends up inputting a wrong username or password, the system displays a warning message showing “Invalid 
Username or Password”.

7.Registration Verification 

Here You can register Your profile:-
 


 
shows the registration verification after a user has successfully filled in the boxes with the appropriate 
information. The system returns a message to the user showing the left blank boxes to fill and a “Registration 
successful, proceed to login” message if all boxes are filled correctly. This information is stored in the database 
and in turn this information is used by the user to login to the system. 

8. Booking Verification 

Here you can book your trip:-
 
 







9.Payment :-
 
The user has a choice of making reservations online during and before visitation. shows a validation of 
a user request who has successfully made a reservation.  

10. Database Testing For Login page:-
Database testing is essential because it helps to obtain errors which might affect the system performance, 
reliability, consistency and security. It also helps to validate the system against the requirement specified by the 
user  . It is essential one performs database testing to obtain a database system which satisfies the acid 
properties (Atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) of a database management system.
